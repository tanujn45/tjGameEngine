# tjGameEngine

This project is about me learning how to draw graphics in a low level way. Yes, I know there are libraries like SDL which can make my life much much easier, but I am going to do it this way. 

The main agenda here is to learn X11 library and make a game engine which can be used to complete our nesEmulator.
