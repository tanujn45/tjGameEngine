# tjGameEngine

## Overview

**tjGameEngine** is a simple c++ class that creates a window using X11 library and allows for pixel manipulation and drawing directly onto the window. I am developing this project to facilitate graphics rendering in a NES emulator, another project that I am working on.

## Installation

Ensure you have X11 development libraries installed in your system.

I have an Arch system. If you do too, run:

```bash
sudo pacman -S libx11-dev
```

Just put tjGameEngine.h in your project and include it when compiling your project.
